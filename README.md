## Real-time Chat Application

Experimenting with real-time chat application using Node.js, Express and Socket.io

## Tech

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - evented I/O for the backend
-   [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - fast node.js network app framework
-   [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication

## Things to implement (in my free time, not a priority project...)

-   [x] Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
-   [] Add support for nicknames.
-   [] Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
-   [] Add "{user} is typing" functionality.
-   [] Show who’s online.
-   [] Add private messaging.
