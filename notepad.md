--------------------

Here's an example of how to broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects using Socket.io:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  // broadcast to all users when a new user connects
  socket.broadcast.emit("user connected", `${socket.id} has joined the chat`);

  // emit to all users when a user disconnects
  socket.on("disconnect", () => {
    io.emit("user disconnected", `${socket.id} has left the chat`);
  });
});
```

In this example, we're using the `socket.broadcast.emit()` method to broadcast a message to all connected users except the newly connected user. The message is sent when a new user connects and includes the newly connected user's `socket.id`.

Similarly, we're using the `socket.on("disconnect", () => {...})` method to listen for the `disconnect` event and emit a message to all connected users when a user disconnects. This message includes the disconnected user's `socket.id`.

Note that the messages we're broadcasting are just strings. You could modify the messages to include additional data, or you could broadcast more complex data structures. The important thing is that you're using `socket.broadcast.emit()` to send the message to all connected users except the sender, and `io.emit()` to send the message to all connected users, including the sender.

--------------------

When working with socket.io, you typically register event listeners and handlers inside the `io.on("connection", (socket) => { ... });` callback, which is executed every time a new client connects to the server.

However, you can split your event listeners and handlers into separate functions for better organization and maintainability. For example, you can define a function to handle incoming chat messages, like this:

```js
function handleChatMessage(socket, msg) {
    console.log(`Received message: ${msg}`);
    // ... do something with the message ...
}
```

Then, you can register this function as an event listener inside the `io.on("connection", (socket) => { ... });` callback:

```js
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    console.log(`Client connected: ${socket.id}`);

    socket.on("chat message", (msg) => {
        handleChatMessage(socket, msg);
    });

    // ... add more event listeners here ...
});
```

This way, you can keep your code organized and modular, and easily add or remove event listeners as needed.


```js
// this doesn't work 
io.on("connection", (socket) => {
    
        socket.on("chat message", (msg) => {
            socket.broadcast.emit("chat message", msg);
        })
        socket.on("connect", () => {
            socket.broadcast.emit("user connected");
        })
        socket.on("disconnect", () => {
            socket.broadcast.emit("user disconnected");
        });
});
```
